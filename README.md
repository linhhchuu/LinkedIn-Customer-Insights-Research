# LinkedIn Customer Insights and Analytics: Student Premium Subscription Study

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether introducing **student-focused features** on LinkedIn, specifically an **Internship Hub**, would increase students' willingness to subscribe to **LinkedIn Premium**. Motivated by the surge in job search anxiety among Gen Z and the growing importance of career platforms, this study aims to bridge the gap between student needs and LinkedIn's Premium offerings.

## Research Question
> **Will LinkedIn Early Career features increase students' willingness to upgrade to LinkedIn Premium?**

## Methodology
The research was conducted in **two phases**:
- **Phase 1: Qualitative Research**  
  - 10 in-depth interviews with undergraduate and graduate students
  - Explored internship search pain points, perceptions of LinkedIn Premium, and reactions to the proposed Internship Hub
  - Used **deductive coding** to identify unmet needs and value gaps

- **Phase 2: Quantitative Research**  
  - Survey of 100+ qualified early-career respondents (students and recent grads)
  - Experimental design with randomized treatments (Control, Centralization concept, Networking concept)

  - Applied **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)**, **K-Means Clustering**, and **Logistic Regression** to model subscription intent drivers

## Key Techniques
- **Exploratory Factor Analysis**: Identified 5 factors explaining perceptions of LinkedIn and Premium value (e.g., job anxiety, functionality, social usage)
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segmented students into three clusters (Proactive Career Hunters, Passive Seekers, Disengaged Doubters)
- **Logistic Regression**: Modeled the likelihood of subscription intent based on feature exposure and user attitudes

## Findings
- Students valued **networking** features the most but found Premium pricing ($40/month) hard to justify without clearer benefits.
- The **Internship Hub** concept improved perceived value, especially if it centralized verified postings and provided recruiter access.
- **Networking-focused messaging** significantly increased willingness to subscribe (+54% lift in intent for some clusters).
- A highly engaged student segment (Proactive Career Hunters) showed **strong innate interest** in Premium even without additional messaging.
- A **value gap** persists between what students expect from Premium and what they experience, suggesting opportunities for better product communication and feature development.

## Recommendations for Next Steps
- Short-term: Utilizing ad campaign to drive social feature usage and improve the gap in Premium perception for low-engaged segments
  - Improve Product Marketing: Target users with low usage through message placement to remind users of relevant existing Premium features 
  - Close the value gap of Cluster 1 and 2: Tailor Ad campaigns to improve Premium value proposition for cluster 1 & 2 through understanding of cluster 3’s engagement patterns
- Long-term: Leveraging customer-centric insights to inform product development opportunities
  - Conduct research from a product-centric approach: Transition from a customer-centric research to a product-centric strategy to align resources and focus on delivering high-value features that meet specific user needs and drive product differentiation
  - Analyze development costs and revenue potential: Evaluate the investment required for product development versus the expected lift in conversion, retention, and CLV.

## Business Impact
- Potential for increased **Premium subscription rate** among early-career users
- Improvement in **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
- Reduction of **student churn** by offering clearer value and better job search support
